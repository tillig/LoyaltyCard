# LoyaltyCard

LoyaltyCard is a web application to generate a combined loyalty/club card.

I loved the (now-offline) "JustOneClubCard" application. I had created a couple of combined cards that I carried with me everywhere.

For a long time phone-based loyalty card apps never worked for me. Since then things have gotten far better and... honestly, while I was going to update this to use React and do the work, there's just no compelling reason to push forward with it. I'll keep the code around in case I ever get the itch, but there are other projects I'm more interested in.
